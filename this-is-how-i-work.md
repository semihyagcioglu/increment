#How I Work#

Over the years, I have developed a routine that I follow every day. I hope it may inspire some people.

**Morning routine**

I wake up around 6:00 to 6:30. No alarms. I have to wake up by myself. I have breakfast around 7:00. I workout for 15 to 30 minutes. Before going to work, I try to find the three most important tasks to be accomplished that day.

Mornings are quiet. I focus better and accomplish more in the mornings. So, I try to cross of as many tasks as I can before going to work.

**Work**

I don't do multitasking. Multitasking is poisonous. I do one thing at a time.

I always prioritirize. I live by the words of Mark Twain, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” [0]

Both at work and at my personal life I apply inbox zero rule.[1] If there is any email pending in my inbox, I do three things. I either reply to it, delete it, or delegate it. Subsequently, if I am done with it, I archive it.

Whatever I do, I try to focus as best as I can. To do so, I try to remove all the clutter, and all distractions while I am working. This is the only way I can work on what really matters.

I work in blocks and use the pomodoro technique, which helps me focus on the current task.[2] I try not to interrupt what I am doing until I finish. You will be amazed to see how much you can accomplish if you give yourself to a task for 20 minutes without any distraction. This motivates me a lot and keeps me sane. I turn work into a game by working in small bursts and completing one task at a time.

I take small breaks, and in these breaks I do whatever I like. Enjoying a coffee with my friends or reading on Quora and Stack Overflow are my favorite break time activities.

**Eating**

I do not like eating alone. I always eat with friends and colleagues. This is a great way to connect with people. Talking about small stuff, ideas, projects helps you catch up. It doesn't matter how busy you are. After all, we all eat. 

I prefer eating out, whenever possible. It is refreshing and helps me clear my mind.

**Note-taking**

For taking notes I use a squared Moleskine notebook and a black pen. I developed an adaptation of bullet journal.[3] I try to save every bit of useful information. It is always surprising to see something you already forgot when you go back to your older notes. 

For years I used mobile or laptop to take notes beside paper notes, however it became painful to manage these notes without a proper structure. So, I developed a framework to manage the notes I take. Mobile note-taking is great. But at some point it is either rude or not convenient to use a laptop or a mobile phone to take notes. People would think you are sending a text or just checking email if you are in a meeting. So, I started carrying a small notebook with me. Although it is not always very easy to carry an additional notebook with you, it became essential for me. Especially, I keep it bed side. You can't know when ideas would come.

**Tools**

I use Evernote to jot down any piece of ideas. I use it whenever possible. From all my devices. I digitize any physical stuff as best as I can to avoid clutter and save them to Evernote.

I use GitHub for all my projects, even for my writings.

I love writing. I use ZenPen web app for writing and use a markdown editor for editing.[4] It is simple, and looks great. I use LaTeX for academic writing or whenever I need something fancy looking.[5]

I read articles via RSS. I do a little bit Twitter. I don't do Facebook.

I use a Pomodoro app, a very minimalist one, which just has a counter.

**Night routine**

After dinner, I continue working. Before I go to sleep, I have a short workout session, which is no more than 15 minutes. This way I feel refreshed and can continue working. 

I review my notes before I go to sleep. Both the paper notes I have taken during the day, and the digital ones. I try to clear my inbox and take the necessary actions for each item.

I plan the next day after reviewing my notes. Knowing what to work on next lifts a heavy weight on my shoulders. 

I try to do one thing *for me* no matter how tired I am. Reading a book, watching a TV show or writing is among my favorite things. This is very important for me and I try to keep it that way.

**Notes**

[0] Despite tradition, the quote may have not actually been authored by Mr. Twain. See [Quote Investigator](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/03/eat-frog/).

[1] [Inbox zero](http://inboxzero.com/) is an approach in which you try to clear your inbox and remove all the clutter.

[2] [Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) is a technique in which you work for 25 minutes of blocks and give 5 or 15 minutes of breaks.

[3] [Bullet journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) is a great method if you fancy note-taking and making lists.

[4] [ZenPen](http://www.zenpen.io/) is the ultimate minimalist web app I found so far for writing. It helps you to focus on the content. I just write and save as markdown to continue writing offline.

[5] [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) is a treat for your eyes. Every time I see a document, either printed or not, I will notice if it is written in LaTeX. It is that good.

**Thanks** to Kevin McKeown for inspiring me to write this, and Evrim Doğanyiğit, Aykut Aras, and Mehmet Kordacı for reading drafts of this.
