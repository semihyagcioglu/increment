#Unlearning

We start learning stuff pretty early. Learning is normally constant. It may slow down, but it is something you can't stop. Along the way we make mistakes. A lot of mistakes. This is a way of learning. We learn from our mistakes, also with guidance.[fn-vygotskyzpd] Most of the learning takes place in, well, schools. What happens in schools is something different. But let's fast forward for a few years.

Out of college, most of us join work force. We start learning how things work in a new environment, like a fish trying to figure out where to swim. Along the way, we learn stuff. How to do things the way they should be done, how not to make that *stupid decision*. Stuff like this. As the time passes, we become more experienced—seasoned they say.

The things we learn help us move forward, step up. I find it interesting that we have to figure out where to put the stuff we learn and try to make sense out of it. Things we learned before can be harmful. After all, the things we know may be the only obstacle to move forward.

Making decisions based on a fallacy would probably lead to bad decisions. I am not overlooking the power of probability here, you can still have good results based on the false judgments. Judging the newly acquired information happens based on the former learnings. We are generally very prone to false judgment based on not knowing or false knowing—not knowing and false knowing are completely two different things. Although both can harm you, false knowing may harm you more. Just look at the people who lost their lifetime savings in stock market with a speculation—they did not not know, they just got the wrong tip.

**Reversing the Damage**

There is a project management concept which I find very useful, *lessons learned*. Not what did we do great, not how clever we are, but where we screwed up. Learning from past failures is very important, alas we tend to forget this very frequently. What project managers discovered and use as best practice, nowadays seem very popular, at least in business. Business people become accustomed to this type of concepts when these concepts start pouring from one collegue's mouth. Business people love fancy words. This is where we mix things up. Just having a fancy presentation slide with a lessons learned title doesn't make us more clever. On the contrary the more we see them the more blinded we become by these things.

How can we reverse the damage done, if there is such a thing? Is it possible to redeem the results of our *this is best decision* decisions. There are plenty of things that we can't just undo. But starting to learn from our past mistakes may start reversing the damage undone. On the long term, this type of attitude would prevail over just ignoring our screw ups.

We need more of this type of lessons learned concepts and they should be introduced in kindergardens.

**Relearning**

Unlearning is not an easy process. Why do we let go our hardly earned knowledge or gathered skill? How to do that, is another thing, but let's focus on why should we unlearn.[fn-unlearn-1]

Our experiences makes us what we are. The random thoughts, the accidents, the tears and the laughs. You can't undo experiences—try undoing your last tear. We can however unlearn what we thought was best and replace it with another best. Pretty simple, yes. The application may not be that simple. Most of us stagger changing ideas, shifting through one thought to an opposite may be difficult. Most of us are taught to think in a prescribed way, and solve problems as they *should be* solved. If something is broken, we already have an idea about what could have gone wrong. We think, decide, act based on our former learnings.

Putting the newly acquired information to a part of the puzzle may sometimes work. What if the part we choose belongs to a different puzzle? What if there is no proper place to put that part into the existing puzzle? We should start asking questions and at least try removing a few parts, in order to see if the part in question could fit into the whole picture.

We need to unlearn stuff pretty fast. When we make mistakes, when a way you use to solve problems doesn't work anymore, consider getting rid of it. Start redefining things, not when they start failing you, but before. Having the pile of thoughts, point of views is not necessarily a bad thing, but when you start losing the ability to change them, if the *lessons learned* can not be *relearned*, then there is a big problem.

It is hard to remove the effect of environment from what we learn. We absorb the information and experiences and where these take place is important. Which also means, when the environment change, the learnings may not be valid any more. When your team members change, nothings is same. When your company or project change, you can't rely on the former learnings. You need to unlearn some of the things you relied on and start relearning, since most of these learnings were already an adaptation to a new environment. In project management, a project is described as unique. If you want to *redo* the same project over and over, something will be different each time. The environment, the people, the cash flow, the lessons, etc.
